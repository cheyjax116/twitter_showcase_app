What I learned: <br>
This project allowed me to grow accustomed to full stack development and separation of concerns. I learned a lot about connecting a server and pulling data from the frontend. It also allowed me to familiarize myself with Twitter's API and the different approaches to formatting its data. I was met with a ton of bugs throughout the project which worked in my favor to help me gain a deeper understanding of the full stack process and working with both internal and external APIs.
